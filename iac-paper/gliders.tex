\subsection{General Overview}

Each team can choose an arbitrary payload to design and build. The team decided to develop long-term a set of gliders that are, once deployed from the rocket, flying back to the ground in formation. 


For this year, the team prepared a technology demonstrator consisting of only one glider deployed at apogee. This can be extrapolated for a fleet of 7 gliders. The challenge of building more gliders lies in fitting them into a constrained space in the rocket. 

\paragraph{Motivation for choosing the payload}
\hfill \break
Rovers such as Curiosity or Spirit have studied Martian terrain and sent back scientific data which may answer questions regarding the origin of life. However, in-situ atmospheric measurements of Mars on longer distances are missing. In order to solve this need, gliders, balloons, or powered planes should overfly Mars and land in areas where rovers cannot. Several projects are proposed by NASA in these directions such as the Preliminary Research Aerodynamic Design to Land on Mars (Prandtl-m) Airplane which aims to be released from a 3U CubeSat and do a 1-hour descent onto the surface of Mars.

Inspired by the Prandtl-m project, our team aimed to design and build an autonomous glider for the Spaceport America Cup competition, and learn more about the flight dynamics and control of such a complex system.

\subsection{Design and Manufacturing of one glider}
%Pictures from report here

Due to space constraints, the glider was chosen to be a flying wing with the wings folded in front. XFLR simulations experiments with different airfoils, wing span, wing sweep were performed until the acceptable flight parameters were obtained. The final airfoil is a MH45, with improved (3\%) reflex.

The plane parameters are presented in Table \ref{plane_param}.

The glider was designed in Solidworks. All the components of the glider are encapsulated either in the fuselage, or in the wings, as it can be seen in Figure \ref{f:fuseg} and Figure  \ref{f:wings}.

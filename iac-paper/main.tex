The Intercollegiate Rocket Competition (IREC) aims to gather students from across the world to design and build a rocket that reaches an altitude of 3km or 10km, carrying a 4kg of payload. As part of this competition, the Team Duster, formed by students from Swiss universities developed a rocket with a payload targeting an apogee of 3km. \\ 
Firstly, the rocket flying to 3km will be presented, along with its design and manufacturing processes. The rocket then follows a dual-event recovery process. Firstly, the drogue (small) parachute is deployed, reducing the speed of the rocket to about 30 m/s. At the same time the separation of the nosecone occurs thereby releasing the payload. After the rocket descends to an altitude of 457 meters, the second (main) parachute is deployed, reducing the speed to 6m/s. Throughout the launch, separation, and landing phases, we constantly received telemetry (information) provided by the custom-designed avionic components placed in the nosecone of the rocket. To ensure that the deployment occurs at predefined altitudes, the decision was made to use 2 redundant systems for altitude measurement -independent of the avionics placed in the recovery bay. The trajectory of the rocket was simulated in 3 varying environments, including our own developed simulator. The rocket made its first flight towards the end of March 2017 in Switzerland where its flight data was compared with the simulation data. Based on this data, the necessary trajectory corrections were performed in order to improve the competition Flight - which occured in mid-June. \\
Secondly, an innovative payload that flew in the rocket will also be presented. A fleet of 3 gliders are deployed from the rocket at apogee using a release based on a spring mechanism. Equipped with an autopilot, differential GPS, and control surfaces using servomotors, the gliders autonomously fly in formation. Eventually, they land at a fixed point on the ground. The gliders have a wing span of approximately 200mm and a body length of 100mm. During the flight, the gliders transmit information back to the groundstation and are tracked using custom-made ground station.  Potential video-recording of the flight will be investigated in the future.
The results of the intermediary flight (end-of-March) as well as the competition flight - both in terms of rocket trajectory and flight of the gliders - is included in the paper, along with further recommendations for a more advanced technology demonstration in the future.}

\section{Introduction}

Spaceport America Cup (formerly entitled Intercollegiate Rocket Competition (IREC)) gatheres students all over the world to participate at the biggest rocket challenge. Students are launching solid, liquid, and hybrid rockets to target altitudes of 10,000 feet (3048 meters) and 30,000 feet (9144 meters), carrying 8,8lb (3.9 kg) of payload.

Team DUSTER, representing several Swiss universities, entered this contest to build a solid motor rocket flying to an apogee of 10,000 ft (3048 meters). The project received an honourable place 8$^th$, out of 83 teams.

This paper contains the work developed by the team of students during November 2016 and June 2017. The first part of the article discusses the rocket design, manufacturing and flight data. The second part of the article reviews the payload placed inside the rocket. For this year, the team built a glider that was deployed at 10,000 ft and flew back to the ground. For the future, the aim is to develop a fleet of gliders that is deployed from the rocket at apogee and flies in formation back to the ground. As part of this article, the fleet of gliders will be only conceptually discussed.

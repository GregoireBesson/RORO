NOTE!
For our report use file RORO_Report.tex. References go in bibtex_database.bib. I will later delete all unnecessary files. The word file is the official template from the competition, latex template is the AIAA paper template which is very similar but we will have to change few things later!

This is the file `README', which is part of the `aiaa' distribution.

Run 'latex aiaa.ins' to produce the files aiaa-tc.cls and aiaa.bst.

This distribution contains a LaTeX class (aiaa-tc.cls) and bibliography
style file (aiaa.bst) that are used to create AIAA technical conference
papers.  (Both can be obtained by processing aiaa.ins with with LaTeX.)

This distribution also contains a Users Manual (aiaa.pdf), AIAA paper
submission instructions (author_guide.pdf), and a template from which
to start your paper (template.tex).

For adventurous soles, there is also an example conference paper
that employs advanced, third-party LaTeX packages (advanced_example.tex).

For further details, such as installation instructions or how to get
support, please read the Users Manual (aiaa.pdf).
